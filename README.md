# A library written from scratch which compresses all data and transfers them between nodes.
## Aim is to do it purely in Haskell and Bash, but WIP, so who knows

Structure :
* Huffman Coding for Compression:
	* Input is data and histogram
	* Output is Huffman tree
	* Requirements do include a de-compressor engine
